E-commerce democracy. Fully integrated online catalog for small manufacturers. 

###Motivation

A web presence solution for small manufacturers. Small Indian manufacturers frequently use Android phones to stay in touch with buyers and to present new inventory etc. Most invest in a small website that they cannot manage themselves which invariably falls to the wayside. This website provides a solution in the form of a dead simple (yet fully featured) online catalog that they can be managed by low-tech businesses purely from a smarthpone. 

##Scale of project

The buyer side frontent is fully functional. The business side is also functional but is web-only right now. I'm building a REST API to allow for easy integration with mobile apps (mostly likely HTML5). The backend is fully functional. 

###Tools

Laravel framework
MYSQL database
Twitter Bootstrap
Angular
